# FertiScan Prototype

## Overview Description

---
The FertiScan project, initiated by the AI-Lab, aims to streamline the process
of capturing and organizing information on fertilizer labels. By leveraging AI
technology, the mobile application will allow users to scan fertilizer labels,
extract essential data, and automatically load this data into a database for
easy access and analysis. This project involves the AI-Lab, the CFIA, and
clients such as inspectors and teams who will benefit from the streamlined
process. FertiScan is a web application that facilitates the inspection process
wherever internet access is available. By automating fertilizer bag inspection,
the project aims to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the inspection
process. Through the integration of the Gemini Vertex API, the system can
analyze fertilizer bag labels more thoroughly, identifying not only basic
information but also subtle differences that may escape human inspection.
The FertiScan prototype is a crucial step towards realizing a complete
automated inspection system. With continuous testing and improvements, it has
the potential to transform the way fertilizer bag inspections are conducted,
bringing an advanced technological solution to the agricultural sector.

## Key Features

---
**Gemini Vertex API:** An application programming interface designed to
simulate human conversation, capable of answering questions and processing
a large number of images.
**Testing Process:** Rigorous testing is conducted to demonstrate that
the Gemini Vertex API, created by Google, is the appropriate method for the
FertiScan project.
It meets various criteria and achieves two main objectives:
reading labels during recording and identifying differences with bags analyzed
by inspectors.

## Potential Advantages

---
**Increased Efficiency:** By automating fertilizer bag inspection, the project
aims to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the inspection process.
**Advanced Analysis:** Through the integration of the Gemini Vertex API, the
system can analyze fertilizer bag labels more thoroughly, identifying not only
basic information but also subtle differences that may escape human inspection.

## Future Outlook

The FertiScan prototype is a crucial step toward realizing a
comprehensive automated inspection system. With continuous testing and
improvements, it has the potential to transform the way fertilizer bag
inspections are conducted, bringing an advanced technological
solution to the agricultural sector.
