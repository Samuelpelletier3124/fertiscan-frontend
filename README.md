# Harvester Prototype (FertiScan)

## Overview Description

---
The Harvester project, hosted on Azure DevOps, represents a significant 
advancement in fertilizer bag inspection. The primary goal of this prototype is
to test and validate various potential solutions that could be integrated into 
the final project. The AI-Lab team, utilizing unit tests, strives to determine 
the best approach to address issues associated with fertilizer bag inspection.

## Key Features

---
**Gemini Vertex API:** An application programming interface designed to 
simulate human conversation, capable of answering questions and processing 
a large number of images.
**Testing Process:** Rigorous testing is conducted to demonstrate that
the Gemini Vertex API, created by Google, is the appropriate method for the 
Harvester project. 
It meets various criteria and achieves two main objectives: 
reading labels during recording and identifying differences with bags analyzed 
by inspectors.

## Potential Advantages

---
**Increased Efficiency:** By automating fertilizer bag inspection, the project 
aims to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the inspection process.
**Advanced Analysis:** Through the integration of the Gemini Vertex API, the 
system can analyze fertilizer bag labels more thoroughly, identifying not only 
basic information but also subtle differences that may escape human inspection.

## Future Outlook

The Harvester prototype is a crucial step toward realizing a
comprehensive automated inspection system. With continuous testing and 
improvements, it has the potential to transform the way fertilizer bag 
inspections are conducted, bringing an advanced technological solution 
to the agricultural sector.
